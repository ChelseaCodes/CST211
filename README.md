# CST211 - Data Structures 
This repo was copied from my VSTS account which is what I used through school for version control. 
This repo contains all my work from Oregon Tech's CST 211 Course which is Data Structures. 
Each folder has assignments/lab from week 0 to 9. 
Labs will be documented better than Assignments and represent my best work for the class.
